# Reuters Text Classification - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a fully connected neural network for multi-class text classification using the Reuters dataset (46 news categories).

## Model Architecture
```
Input (10,000) → Dense(64, ReLU) → Dense(64, ReLU) → Dense(46, Softmax)
```
- **Input**: One-hot encoded word vectors (10,000 most frequent words)
- **Hidden Layers**: Two 64-unit dense layers with ReLU activation
- **Output**: 46-class probability distribution via softmax
- **Loss Function**: Categorical crossentropy
- **Optimizer**: RMSprop

## Dataset
- **Training**: 7,982 samples
- **Validation**: 1,000 samples  
- **Test**: 2,246 samples
- **Classes**: 46 mutually exclusive news topics

## Key Results
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Optimal Epochs** | 14 (determined by max validation accuracy) |
| **Validation Accuracy** | 82.8% |
| **Test Accuracy** | ~79% |
| **Random Baseline** | 18.8% |
| **Training Time** | ~2 minutes for 20 epochs |

## Key Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- Automatic optimal epoch detection based on validation accuracy
- Training history visualization with accuracy/loss curves
- Identification of overfitting point

### Production Enhancements
- **Reproducibility**: Seed parameter for consistent results
- **Memory Efficiency**: Float32 vectorization (50% memory reduction)
- **Flexibility**: Optional regularization (L2 + Dropout)
- **Robustness**: Early stopping callback support
- **Testing**: No-GUI mode for CI/CD environments
- **Verbosity Control**: Configurable output levels

## Visualization & Analysis

### Training History Plots
The dual-panel visualization provides critical insights into model training dynamics:

**Left Panel - Accuracy Curves**:
- **Training Accuracy** (blue): Steadily increases from ~49% to ~95%, showing the model's ability to learn training patterns
- **Validation Accuracy** (red): Rises from ~62% to peak at 82.8% (epoch 14), then plateaus/slightly decreases
- **Green Star & Dashed Line**: Marks the optimal epoch where validation accuracy is maximized
- **Interpretation**: The divergence between training (continuing to improve) and validation (plateauing) curves after epoch 14 is the classic signature of overfitting - the model starts memorizing training data rather than learning generalizable patterns

**Right Panel - Loss Curves**:
- **Training Loss** (blue): Decreases from 2.6 to 0.14, showing successful optimization
- **Validation Loss** (red): Decreases from 1.8 to minimum ~0.87 (epoch 14), then slightly increases
- **Key Insight**: The validation loss inflection point confirms overfitting - the model's predictions become less confident on unseen data after epoch 14
- **Optimal Model Selection**: Both metrics agree that epoch 14 provides the best generalization

### Why This Matters
1. **Early Stopping Decision**: The plots justify stopping at epoch 14 rather than 20, preventing overfitting
2. **Model Reliability**: The ~13% gap between training (95%) and validation (82%) accuracy is acceptable for this complex 46-class problem
3. **Convergence Confirmation**: The smooth curves indicate stable training without erratic behavior
