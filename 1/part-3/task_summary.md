# Task Requirements and Results Summary

## Task Requirements

### Original Assignment
**Objective**: Experiment with various optimizers and hyperparameters for the Reuters text classification network implemented in `part-3.py`.

**Specific Requirements**:
1. Test at least 4 different optimizers
2. Vary hyperparameters for each optimizer
3. Generate validation/training accuracy plots
4. Present results in a table showing best validation accuracy for each optimizer configuration
5. Compare optimizer performance and identify the best configuration

## Implementation Details

### Model Architecture
- **Network**: 256→128→64 units fully connected layers
- **Regularization**: BatchNormalization and Dropout (0.4, 0.3, 0.2 for successive layers)
- **Output**: 46 classes (Reuters topics)
- **Loss Function**: Categorical crossentropy
- **Early Stopping**: Patience of 5 epochs, restore best weights

### Dataset
- **Training**: 7,982 samples
- **Validation**: 1,000 samples  
- **Test**: 2,246 samples
- **Preprocessing**: Binary vectorization with 10,000 word vocabulary

## Results Summary

### Optimizers Selected

| Rank | Optimizer | Best Config | Val Acc | Test Acc |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| 1 | **RMSprop** | lr=0.001 | **82.80%** | 80.19% |
| 2 | **Adam** | lr=0.001 | **82.70%** | 79.74% |
| 2 | **Adamax** | lr=0.002 | **82.70%** | 80.54% |
| 4 | **AdamW** | lr=0.001, wd=0.001 | **82.50%** | 79.96% |
| 5 | **Nadam** | lr=0.001 | **82.20%** | 79.79% |

### Key Findings

1. **Performance Range**: Top 5 optimizers achieved 82.20-82.80% validation accuracy (only 0.6% spread)

2. **Optimal Learning Rate**: 0.001 was consistently best across most optimizers

3. **Convergence Speed**: 
   - Fastest: Nadam (lr=0.002) at epoch 10
   - Average: Most optimizers converged around epochs 20-24
   - Slowest: Low learning rates (0.0001) required 27-30 epochs

4. **Generalization**: All top optimizers showed good generalization with ~2-3% gap between validation and test accuracy

5. **Winner**: RMSprop with lr=0.001 achieved the best validation accuracy (82.80%) and strong test performance (80.19%)

### Experiments Conducted
- **Total Configurations Tested**: 14 (reduced from original 20)
- **Optimizers Evaluated**: 5 (RMSprop, Adam, Adamax, AdamW, Nadam)
- **Hyperparameters Varied**: 
  - Learning rates: 0.0001, 0.001, 0.002, 0.01
  - Optimizer-specific: rho, beta values, weight decay

## Conclusion

The task successfully identified RMSprop with lr=0.001 as the optimal optimizer for this Reuters text classification task, achieving 82.80% validation accuracy. The top 5 optimizers all performed within a narrow range, suggesting the improved architecture (with BatchNorm and Dropout) is relatively robust to optimizer choice. The significant drop in performance with lr=0.0001 across all optimizers highlights the importance of proper learning rate selection.
