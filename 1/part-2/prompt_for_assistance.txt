PROMPT FOR MODEL ASSISTANCE: REUTERS TEXT CLASSIFICATION OPTIMIZATION
======================================================================

TASK OBJECTIVE
--------------
I need help improving a neural network for multi-class text classification on the Reuters-21578 dataset. The goal is to achieve the highest possible test accuracy, ideally reaching 90%+ if feasible.

CURRENT SITUATION
-----------------
1. Dataset: Reuters-21578 with 46 topic categories
2. Current Implementation: Keras/TensorFlow neural network in Python
3. Input Representation: One-hot encoding with 10,000-word vocabulary
4. Data Split: 7,982 training, 1,000 validation, 2,246 test samples

PERFORMANCE HISTORY
-------------------
- Original Baseline: 76.27% test accuracy (64→64 architecture)
- Current Best: 80.28% test accuracy (256→128→64 architecture with improvements)
- Attempted Optimizations:
  * Wider network (512→384→256→128): 80.59% (+0.31%)
  * Heavy regularization with L2 + MaxNorm: 78.41% (decreased performance)

CURRENT MODEL ARCHITECTURE (Best Performing)
--------------------------------------------
```python
Input (10,000 one-hot encoded)
→ Dense(256) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.4)
→ Dense(128) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
→ Dense(64) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.2)
→ Dense(46, activation='softmax')

Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.001)
Loss: categorical_crossentropy
Callbacks: EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint
```

CONSTRAINTS & LIMITATIONS DISCOVERED
-------------------------------------
1. One-hot encoding creates information bottleneck (sparse 10,000-dim binary vectors)
2. Simply adding more layers/neurons shows diminishing returns
3. Heavy regularization (L2, MaxNorm, high dropout) actually decreased performance
4. Validation accuracy consistently 2-3% higher than test accuracy (generalization gap)
5. Network-only optimizations appear to have ceiling around 81-82%

FILE STRUCTURE
--------------
- part-2.py: Main implementation file with ReutersTextClassifier class
- Key methods:
  * load_and_prepare_data(): Loads Reuters dataset, creates train/val/test splits
  * build_model(architecture='improved'): Builds the neural network
  * train(): Trains model with callbacks
  * plot_training_history(): Visualizes training curves
  * retrain_with_optimal_epochs(): Retrains with best epoch count

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
------------------
1. Given the constraint of one-hot encoding, what's the realistic accuracy ceiling?
2. Are there network architectures better suited for sparse binary input?
3. Would techniques like label smoothing, mixup, or focal loss help?
4. Can we reach 90% accuracy without changing from one-hot encoding? If not, what's required?
5. What specific hyperparameter combinations should be tested next?

WHAT I'VE ALREADY TRIED
------------------------
- Increasing network width (512 neurons): Minimal improvement
- Deeper networks (4-5 layers): No significant gains
- Various dropout rates (0.2-0.55): Current progressive dropout works best
- L2 regularization + MaxNorm constraints: Decreased performance
- Different batch sizes (64, 96, 128, 256, 512): 256 works best
- Early stopping with patience 5: Helps prevent overfitting
- Learning rate reduction on plateau: Provides minor improvements

WHAT I HAVEN'T TRIED YET
------------------------
- Different activation functions (Swish, GELU, LeakyReLU)
- Layer normalization instead of batch normalization
- Residual connections or skip connections
- Different optimizers (AdamW, RMSprop, SGD with momentum)
- Ensemble methods
- Data augmentation techniques for text
- Different loss functions (focal loss, label smoothing)
- Attention mechanisms or self-attention layers
- 1D Convolutional layers for local pattern detection

RESOURCES & CONSTRAINTS
------------------------
- Hardware: Standard laptop/desktop (no GPU requirement specified)
- Framework: Must use Keras/TensorFlow
- Time: Reasonable training time (minutes, not hours)
- Input Format: Must maintain one-hot encoding (10,000 vocab) unless absolutely necessary to change

DELIVERABLES NEEDED
-------------------
1. Specific code modifications to part-2.py to improve accuracy
2. Explanation of why proposed changes should work
3. Expected accuracy improvement from each change
4. Priority order for implementing changes
5. Realistic assessment of whether 90% is achievable

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT
------------------
This is for a Natural Language Processing course assignment. The emphasis is on understanding the limitations of different approaches and achieving the best possible performance within the constraints. The model should be trainable on standard hardware in reasonable time.

Please provide specific, actionable recommendations with code examples where appropriate. Focus on changes that have the highest probability of improving test accuracy beyond the current 80.28%.
